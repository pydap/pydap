# This workflow will attempt to publish the current version of pydap to PyPI
# when either:
# 
# * A GitHub release is published.
# * A manual invocation of the workflow occurs.
#
# Both of the above actions should be limited to repository owners or admins.
# For publication to be successful, the repository must have a PYPI_API_TOKEN
# secret generated by a PyPI user with maintainer (or higher) privileges on the
# pydap package in PyPI.
#
# The build Python package determines the version via setup.py, which in turn
# retrieves the version number from src/pydap/__init__.py.
