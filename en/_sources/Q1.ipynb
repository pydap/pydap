    "* **Authentication**. There may be many redirects. If possible, use `token` authentication, as it reduces the amount of redirects.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Hierarchical metadata**. Some datasets can contain O(100) of variables, and complex nested `Groups` (`Groups` are part of the `DAP4` protocol), and parsing the metadata to create the dataset can be time-consuming. To reduce the timing, you can use the [Data Request Form](https://www.opendap.org/support/online-help-files/) to construct a `Constraint Expression` that reduces the amount of `Groups` and variables you wish to include in your dataset. This will allow you to discard variables before creating the dataset. The documentation on [Constraint expressions](ConstraintExpressions) has an example demonstrating the use of `CE`s to reduce the size of the dataset before the dataset creation for the Atlas03 experiment.\n",

    "* **Subset the Variable**. This limits the size of download (specially when remote datasets are a virtual aggregated of many many remote files). Some organizations impose a 2Gb limit on the download. The [PACE Example](notebooks/PACE) illustrates this point. In it, the coords arrays (`lat` and `lon`) are to identify the subset of 2D array of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cache the Session** . Same as with the dataset creation, a cached session can also store `.dap`/`.dods` responses. This will also limit the times a (repeated) download is requested to the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Diagnosing**. It is possible that the remote dataset has many small chunks, resulting in very slow performance. This, along with internet connection, are performance problems outside of the scope of `pydap`. A useful diagnose if the issue is withg `pydap` or with the remote server, is to use curl to download the response.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "curl -L -n \"<opendap_url_with_constraint_expression>\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "where `-L` implies following redirects, and `-n` instructs `curl` to recover authentication from the `~/.netrc` file. This last one is only necessary when authentication is required. For example, to download a `.dap` (DAP4) response from a dap4 server (with no authentication required):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "curl -L -o output.dap \"http://test.opendap.org/opendap/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc.dap?dap4.ce=/TIME\"\n",

    "The following command downloads only the variable `TIME` from [this test](http://test.opendap.org/opendap/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc.dmr) dataset. The download should be very fast. When slicing an array `pydap` does something very similar: downloads a `.dap` response for a single variable, in this case `TIME`. Pydap should not take too much longer that `curl` to download the `.dap` response.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Check variable sizes and avoid downloading entire arrays of ncml datasets**. `ncml` datasets are a virtual aggregation of a collection of NetCDF files. The `ncml` is great because it provides a single URL endpoint for a single collection, but many users experience long times and downlod errors when requesting to download even a single variable.\n"
